                        Some 20 years ago, I developed a passion for beta versions of Internet Explorer 6 and the
                        Microsoft operating systems at the time. From todays perspective, this seems rather unlikely, if
                        not awkward.

                        <br>
                        But what started as a tiny news site, where I literally hand-crafted the news entries in static
                        HTML files, quickly became a thriving community. During its golden era in the mid-2000s, we had
                        thousands of active users and it was really an exiting experience for me, for which I am still
                        very grateful today.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Having said that, this wouldn't have been possible at all without the help from all the friendly
                        folks that helped me with hosting and moderating this beast. Thank you so much for being part
                        of this journey!
